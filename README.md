# Solace

Solace is a decentralized application (dApp) that facilitates anonymous incident reports. By leveraging blockchain's transaction finality and scalability, Solace democratizes tamper-proof reporting. Furthermore, Solace's reliance on an immutable peer-to-peer network mandates accountability from all parties involved: namely authoritative figures.
